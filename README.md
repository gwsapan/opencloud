OpenCloud
=========

OpenCloud (http://www.opencloud.us) is a research cloud designed to support both cloud builders and cloud users. It targets cloud architects that want to experiment with clean-slate cloud designs and low-level cloud mechanisms, service designers that want to build and demonstrate new cloud services and applications, and scientific users that want to run scientific codes and scale big data computations. OpenCloud is a joint project of ON.Lab, PlanetLab, and Internet2.

This project is for tracking issues in the OpenCloud deployment and software releases.
